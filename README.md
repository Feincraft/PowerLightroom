# PowerLightroom
🤔There's a lot of tasks that require images🖼️ in #PowerApps but there's no way to edit them. 
<br/><br/>Until now 😁 Check out PowerLightroom, a canvas app that can edit images. 

<br/><br/>💡The app allows uploading an image and changing it with 7 different filters.
<br/><br/>⚒️The primary mechanism is saving the image as BASE64 binary in memory, using CSS filters to change it and rendering as HTML.
